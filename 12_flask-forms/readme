QCC:
* How do you store data in servers?
* How do you access or change GET and POST?
* Going to be honest here: we looked at other team's solution
but still don't understand what's going on


Disco:
* Returning request_method can give you the method
* render_template("file.html") can be used to open the file in the browser
