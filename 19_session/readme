Time Spent: 2.5 hrs

QCC:
* Do all secret_key have to be unique? What if by chance, one of the generated
key is not unique?

Disco:
* app.secret_key= os.urandom(32) creates a random secret key with length 32,
it is needed to assign cookies. Flask takes care of all the other stuff.
* session is like a dictionary that stores information like session['username']
gives the value with the key 'username'
* Because session is used very much like a dictionary, methods like pop could be request_method
